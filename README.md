myElectionApp
=============

##Introduction

The idea starts with result of general election of India, 2014.
The data was available at [election comission of India website](http://eciresults.nic.in/ConstituencywiseU011.htm), I pulled the data and saved it to my another [github repo](https://github.com/kuberiitb/analytics/).   
I tried to plot the data using ggplot2 and got [this](https://github.com/kuberiitb/analytics/blob/master/LeadingParty.png), but then I felt singe graph can not give enough information. When I came to know about R shiny package, I gave it some time and now I can say it was fruitful attempt with [myElectionApp](https://kuberiitb.shinyapps.io/myElectionApp/).
